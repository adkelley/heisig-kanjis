## CSV file format
The file heisig-kanjis.csv contains the kanji's featured in James Heisig's "Remembering the Kanji" 1 & 3.
Each line of the CSV file is structured as follows:

Field name | description
--- | ---
*kanji* | the kanji itself
*id_5th_ed* | the kanji's number in RTK, 5th edition
*id_6th_ed* | the kanji's number in RTK, 6th edition
*keyword_5th_ed* | the kanji's keyword in RTK, 5th edition
*keyword_6th_ed* | the kanji's keyword in RTK, 6th edition
*components* | the kanji's components delimited by "; "
*on_reading* | the kanji's on-readings delimited by "; "
*kun_reading* | the kanji's kun-readings delimited by "; "

The components are available for most of the kanjis from RTK 1. However, for kanjis from RTK 3 most components are still missing.
